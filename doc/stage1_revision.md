In our original submission, we only had 1 primary dataset so we lost a point. In this appended version, we added 2 more datasets.

The first dataset we added was a watch marketplace dataset. 
This data set includes the listing and selling price of thousands of watches from an online marketplace.

The second dataset was a listing of all watch brands. This includes attributes specifying their HQ location, year of founding, etc.
